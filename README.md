## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
![Linear Regression]() ![Summary of Linear Regression]()
- From the Pr(>|t|) values above, we can say that the Vehicle length and ground clearance(as well as Intercept) variables provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
- The slope of the lienar model is not zero as the p-value is 5.35 x 10-11 which is much smaller than our assumed significance level of 0.05%.There is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis.
- Since the R-squared value is 0.71, which means that 70% of all mpg values will be correct using this linear model, this linear model can predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.
In your description, address the following questions:
What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
